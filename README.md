# SE-Internship

This project was created for a course at the JKU University in Linz.

All documentations are written in german and are in the folder documentations.

The jar can be found in out/artifacts/GPSTracker_java_jar.

For further releases it is planned to implement the following points:

- major design update to JAVAFX. Details can be found in (1)
- user can choose his own sports. This means we do not provide the sport types and the user can type in his own sport
  types.
- line charts for plausible data like pace
- google maps integration

## (1) JavaFX update

This will be probably the main update to reach a more modern and user-friendly design. It contains more statistics. You
can find it in the following Git: https://github.com/markusschwarz99/GPSTracker
On this update the project will be a maven project using JavaFX and Scene Builder with fxml files for creating the UI.
